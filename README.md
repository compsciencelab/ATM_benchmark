# ATM_benchmark
## Summary
Here you can find the both studies we realized for Relative Binding Free Energy (RBFE) calculations with the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM).

In the `ATM_validation` folder you can find the input files for our initial study where we evaluated ATM with the Benchmark dataset from [Wang _et al_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja512751q).

[Validation of the Alchemical Transfer Method for the Estimation of Relative Binding Affinities of Molecular Series](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00178)

In the `ATM_with_NNPs` folder you can find the necessary data from our latest study. Where we combine the capabilities of ATM with the NNP/MM methodology.
